        My Home Library is a program that uses a web-based tool hosted by the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation. Through the My 
        Home Library web-based tool, community members are able to sponsor a home library for an economically disadvantaged child. 
        My Home Library was developed in late 2016 in partnership with Credera and a team of volunteer technologist from across the Houston community.
